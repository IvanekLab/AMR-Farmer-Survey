This study is a survey of dairy farmers/managers in New York, USA. A total of 118 responses were included in the statistical analyses to evaluate: (i) level of concern about antibiotic resistance and (ii) interest in adopting new judicious antibiotic use practices regarding mastitis treatment. Here, we include a spreadsheet for analyses described in the study (AMR Farmer Survey_data).
